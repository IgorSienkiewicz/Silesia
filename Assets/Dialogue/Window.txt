<i>Why are you cleaning the windows daily, grandpa?</i>
<i>Do you really like doing it?</i>
You need to keep the windows clean.
They are the calling card of the family behind them.
Itâ€™s a status symbol.
Keeping them clean is a showing of our work ethic.
Either way I already got used to it.
You have to clean them daily, because there is a lot of soot in the air.
If we were not cleaning them, you could not see the beautiful neighborhood outside.
