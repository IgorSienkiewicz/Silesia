<i>What’s that!</i>
Oh..
You found it! It’s Zbigniew’s miner dog tag.
Everyone used to have them.
We always had to take them with us when we were going down to the shafts.
They were used for identifying who is still underground.
After the day’s work we had to leave the tag in the front office.
If someone's mark was there after the shift ended it meant no good. 

…
Wait.
…
This is not my tag!
My number was xxx…
I wonder to whom does this one belong
…
I think I know someone who might know.
Come with me.
