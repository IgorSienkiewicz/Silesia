<i>That building looks exactly like yours!</i>
Yes, because they are.
All of the buildings in the neighborhood look very similar.
They were mass built to house us miners back in the day.
All my friends from the community lived there.
They look the same on the outside, but the insidesâ€¦
On the inside they are all so different and individual.
